# E-Commerce Demo
A simple PHP + MySQL CRUD project with relational database.

## Prerequisites
- Apache
- MySQL Server
I recommend using XAMPP as it comes with built-in Apache for PHP and MySQL Server.

## Setup
1. Go to you XAMPP htdocs directory (usually in `C:\xampp\htdocs`, depending on where you installed your XAMPP)
2. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/khianvictorycalderon/e-commerce-demo.git`
3. Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP control panel.
4. Go to your browser and run `localhost/e-commerce-demo`
5. Enjoy!
